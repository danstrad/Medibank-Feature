All high res videos please.
screenSaver for info4 - video?

 
 
*Slowing down after multiple videos have played.
*Make the screensavers trigger after a time, whether the end of the story is reached or not.
*Improve performance however possible
	*Flag to toggle bitmap caching?
		*cache TextContent

*Restrict camera and frame new stories better in Core
	*instead of camera bounds, tether it to each box on the screen?
*Video improvements in Core too
 

?Show different video snippets in the different features (currently all play from the start of the gen better ad)
"Swipe here" on the bars for Feature (or some other instructions to let people know)
Audio on videos and screensaver (Do we need to source/approve audio for the screensaver?)


One version with CACHE_AND_SNAP, one without
 
 
Audio starting at video offsets is going to be weird
audio on video sounds mental
 
Who is managing the iPad content?

	*1. Whenever you select one of the pluses the building could fade slightly and possibly scale down.
	*2. Before people click the pluses, they might do the same little jump as the purple squares. Or if that's too excessive just the slow fades. 

General comments
·         Screen saver – it only works when you touch the screen, not when you swipe

fade screenSavers after click?
draggable screensaver overlay?

Need a way to stop each feature mid way and return to home/screen saver

should the current tab fade out completely so people dont try to drag it? or stay a bit brighter?
