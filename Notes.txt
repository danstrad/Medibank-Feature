All high res videos please.

* Used splash slide to start, to avoid this: Starting on a video allows it to fast forward through its boxes, or leith is playing somehow
* Should all infographics end on blank and a replay button appear? Yes. Apart from hotspots

*art1: IS IT TIME TO UNPLUG?
~	"our study" - floating boxes side text can't change

~doc2: MEETING THE MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGE
	*made mono beyondblue logo myself. Good enough?
	*beyondblue name should be in italics at the end
	~video offset
	*video wipes
	
*info4: MEDIBANK COMMUNITY FUND
	*missing image/video slide with no text at the start
	*Same after "helping through participation"
	
~doc7: REWARDING BETTER HEALTH WITH FLYBUYS AND MEDIBANK.
~	video offset
	*video wipes

*prof9: A HEALTHIER WAY OF WORKING
	*Button placement?
	*1. Whenever you select one of the pluses the building could fade slightly and possibly scale down.
	*2. Before people click the pluses, they might do the same little jump as the purple squares. Or if that's too excessive just the slow fades. 

*prof1: MEET LEITH
	*used static launch screen to get around pausesync issues on first slide
	*video offset
	*video wipes
	
vision: OUR VISION
~	187%
	*boxes should be bold? Text doesn't look styled properly

A way to restart, at least in core
	needed in feature?
	maybe for hotspots in the corner?

Medibank logo next to beyondblue one
beyondblue in italics - Core too

Building changes
Arrange things on the building better?


should the current tab fade out completely so people dont try to drag it? or stay a bit brighter?

General comments
·         Screen saver – it only works when you touch the screen, not when you swipe
·         Need a way to stop each feature mid way and return to home/screen saver
 
Flybuys feature
·         Should be able to restart message for all features once you’ve finished – there was no replay at the end of the Flybuys feature



DAN:-------------------------
Unplug, last box appeared over left text
dots in middle of people graph
bigger left text on floatingBoxes
some timing makes it hard to read.
