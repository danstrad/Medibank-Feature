	*1. Whenever you select one of the pluses the building could fade slightly and possibly scale down.
	*2. Before people click the pluses, they might do the same little jump as the purple squares. Or if that's too excessive just the slow fades. 

General comments
·         Screen saver – it only works when you touch the screen, not when you swipe

fade screenSavers after click?
draggable screensaver overlay?

Need a way to stop each feature mid way and return to home/screen saver

should the current tab fade out completely so people dont try to drag it? or stay a bit brighter?
