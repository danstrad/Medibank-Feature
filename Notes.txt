General comments
·         Screen saver – it only works when you touch the screen, not when you swipe

fade screenSavers after click?
draggable screensaver overlay?

Need a way to stop each feature mid way and return to home/screen saver

should the current tab fade out completely so people dont try to drag it? or stay a bit brighter?
