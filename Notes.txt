* Used splash slide to start, to avoid this: Starting on a video allows it to fast forward through its boxes, or leith is playing somehow
* Should all infographics end on blank and a replay button appear? Yes. Apart from hotspots

*art1: IS IT TIME TO UNPLUG?

	*Button placement?
	*1. Whenever you select one of the pluses the building could fade slightly and possibly scale down.

*prof1: MEET LEITH
	*used static launch screen to get around pausesync issues on first slide
	*video offset
	*video wipes
	
vision: OUR VISION
